  abstract={Results-based financing has guided the development of policies with measurable results improving learning outcomes at micro/macro levels. However, it is then necessary to identify factors which predict early and accurately favorable or challenging conditions for learning. Learning outcomes depend on complex interactions between multiple variables, many of which are not fully understood. The objective was to develop valid and accurate models predicting low and high levels of math performance and Vietnamese language, using machine-learning algorithms, as part of an international large-scale project in primary education in Vietnam. The models achieved very high accuracy (95–100%). A strong common pattern has been found for both Math and Vietnamese language, for the low and high levels of performance: the individual cognitive characteristics, physical factors and daily routines/ activities of the child are very important predictive factors of academic performance, as measured by student performance in the final Grade 5 test in math and Vietnamese, respectively. Parental expectations, pre-school attendance and school trajectory of students have added relative importance in the classification. In order to accurately identify an expected low or high academic performance outcome, it is the full pattern of variables contained in the vector of information from each case that should be considered. Because, although each variable in a particular vector has a small contribution to the total predictive weight, it is the overall pattern containing the interactions between these variables that carries the necessary information for the accurate predictions. In addition, the identification of specific patterns for extreme groups of performance provides the necessary guidance for more focused educational interventions/investment and sound educational policies.}

  abstract = {Prediction models that underlie “early warning systems” need improvement. Some predict outcomes using entrenched, unchangeable characteristics (e.g., socioeconomic status) and others rely on performance on early assignments to predict the final grades to which they contribute. Behavioral predictors of learning outcomes often accrue slowly, to the point that time needed to produce accurate predictions leaves little time for intervention. We aimed to improve on these methods by testing whether we could predict performance in a large lecture course using only students’ digital behaviors in weeks prior to the first exam. Early prediction based only on malleable behaviors provides time and opportunity to advise students on ways to alter study and improve performance. Thereafter, we took the not-yet-common step of applying this model and testing whether providing digital learning support to those predicted to perform poorly can improve their achievement. Using learning management system log data, we tested models composed of theory-aligned behaviors using multiple algorithms and obtained a model that accurately predicted poor grades. Our algorithm correctly identified 75% of students who failed to earn the grade of B or better needed to advance to the next course. We applied this model the next semester to predict achievement levels and provided a digital learning strategy intervention to students predicted to perform poorly. Those who accessed advice outperformed classmates on subsequent exams, and more students who accessed the advice achieved the B needed to move forward in their major than those who did not access advice.}

	abstract = {Educational data mining has become an effective tool for exploring the hidden relationships in educational data and predicting students' academic achievements. This study proposes a new model based on machine learning algorithms to predict the final exam grades of undergraduate students, taking their midterm exam grades as the source data. The performances of the random forests, nearest neighbour, support vector machines, logistic regression, Naïve Bayes, and k-nearest neighbour algorithms, which are among the machine learning algorithms, were calculated and compared to predict the final exam grades of the students. The dataset consisted of the academic achievement grades of 1854 students who took the Turkish Language-I course in a state University in Turkey during the fall semester of 2019–2020. The results show that the proposed model achieved a classification accuracy of 70–75\%. The predictions were made using only three types of parameters; midterm exam grades, Department data and Faculty data. Such data-driven studies are very important in terms of establishing a learning analysis framework in higher education and contributing to the decision-making processes. Finally, this study presents a contribution to the early prediction of students at high risk of failure and determines the most effective machine learning methods.},

Employers often believe grades are useful predictors, and they make hiring decisions that are based on them. Many academics believe that grades have little predictive validity. Past meta-analyses of the grades–performance relationship have suffered either from small sample sizes or the inability to correct observed correlations for research artifacts. This study demonstrated the observed correlation between grades and job performance was .16. Correction for research artifacts increased the correlation to the .30s. Several factors were found to moderate the relationship. The most powerful factors were the year of research publication and the time between graduation and performance measurement.
