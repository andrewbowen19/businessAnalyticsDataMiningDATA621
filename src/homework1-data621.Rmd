```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Setup:

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(glue)
library(tidyverse)
library(car)
library(ResourceSelection)
```

First, let's read in the provided dataset.

```{r data-read-in, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
df <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andrewbowen19/businessAnalyticsDataMiningDATA621/main/data/moneyball-training-data.csv")
df <- data.frame(df)
```

## Data Exploration:

Next, let's print out some summary statistics. We're primarily interested in the `TARGET_WINS` variable, so we'll look at that first.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
mean_wins <- mean(df$TARGET_WINS)
median_wins <- median(df$TARGET_WINS)
sd_wins <- sd(df$TARGET_WINS)

# Print summary stats
print(glue("The mean number of wins in a season is {mean_wins}."))
print(glue("The median number of wins in a season is {median_wins}."))
print(glue("The standard deviation for number of wins in a season is {sd_wins}."))
```

Let's also make a histogram of the `TARGET_WINS` variable. This should give us a sense of the distribution of wins for teams/seasons in our population.

```{r wins-hist, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(df, aes(x=TARGET_WINS)) + geom_histogram()
```

Overall, the number of wins in a season for a given baseball team looks fairly normally distributed. Looking at a boxplot helps to highlight the outliers.

```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(df, aes(x=TARGET_WINS)) + geom_boxplot()
```

Let's look at raw correlations between our other included variables and a team's win total for a season: 

```{r basic-correlations, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
train <- subset(df, select=-c(INDEX))
cor(train, df$TARGET_WINS)
```
Let's review relationships between batting independent variables

```{r batting_rel,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE}
train_cleaned <- train |> rename_all(~stringr::str_replace(.,"^TEAM_",""))
subset_batting <- na.omit(train_cleaned |> select(contains('Batting')))
ResourceSelection::kdepairs(subset_batting)
```
Most of the batting variables appear to be somewhat approximately normal although there are some cases of right skew. Overall, there aren't any very strong correlations between these statistics at least from a preliminary visual inspection.

Let's review relationships between other independent variables

```{r pitching_rel,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE}
subset_pitching <- na.omit(train_cleaned |> select(!contains('batting')))
ResourceSelection::kdepairs(subset_pitching)
```
There isn't very strong correlation between the other independent variables similar to the batting statistics although there are more examples of skewed data with these inputs.

Let's make a basic model with all inputs:

```{r scatter-plots, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
lm_all <- lm(TARGET_WINS~., train)
summary(lm_all)
```

We can see that the $R^2$ value of a model that includes all the variables is not particularly high. Given the fact that the F-score has a very low p-value and there aren't many significant independent variables it is fairly obvious that there are potential multicollinearity issues within this model.


Reviewing the variance inflation factors

```{r}
vif(lm_all)
```
This model is suffering from considerable impact from the number of collinear predictors as multiple columns are off the charts given that a score of 5 tends to be far too much collinearity in a least squares regression model.

Let's review the dependent and collinear independent variables

```{r collinear_cols}
collinear_cols <- na.omit(train_cleaned |> select(TARGET_WINS,BATTING_H,BATTING_HR,BATTING_BB,BATTING_SO,PITCHING_H,PITCHING_HR,PITCHING_BB,PITCHING_SO))
kdepairs(collinear_cols)

```
Interestingly enough the correlation between these predictors from a preliminary visual review does not seem to identify a substantial amount of collinearity outside of `TEAM_PITCHED_HR` and `TEAM_BATTING_HR`. A few of the other variables potentially have non-linear relationships between them although `TEAM_PITCHING_SO` appears to have several large outliers that might be impacting the model.

We can make some plots to help test our assumptions of our basic model using the `plot` function on our model variable:

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
plot(lm_all)
```

Removing the variables that are least significant to the all-variable model one by one via backward selection, we can produce a reduced, better model:

```{r backward_selection, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# This model will need to be run again once we deal with imputing the missing values for certain variables. 
lm_reduced <- update(lm_all, . ~ . - TEAM_BATTING_SO)
lm_reduced <- update(lm_reduced, . ~ . - TEAM_BASERUN_CS)
lm_reduced <- update(lm_reduced, . ~ . - TEAM_BATTING_HR)
lm_reduced <- update(lm_reduced, . ~ . - TEAM_BATTING_2B)
lm_reduced <- update(lm_reduced, . ~ . - TEAM_PITCHING_H)
lm_reduced <- update(lm_reduced, . ~ . - TEAM_BATTING_BB)
lm_reduced <- update(lm_reduced, . ~ . - TEAM_BASERUN_SB)
lm_reduced <- update(lm_reduced, . ~ . - TEAM_BATTING_3B)
summary(lm_reduced)

```
Let's review VIF in the reduced model

```{r reduced_lm_vif, echo=FALSE,message=FALSE}
vif(lm_reduced)
```
Taking out a number of the independent variables has substantially reduced collinearity within this revised linear model and it is not an issue in this instance of the model.


Now we can make a model with inputs that we know from baseball.

- Total hits (`TEAM_BATTING_H`)
- Total walks gained (`TEAM_BATTING_BB`)
- Total hits allowed (`TEAM_PITCHING_H`)
- Total walks allowed (`TEAM_PITCHING_BB`)

We chose these variables based on our understanding that good teams generally tend to get on base more frequently (positive predictor variables `TEAM_BATTING_HITS` and `TEAM_BATTING_BB`) while allowing *fewer* runners on base (negative predictor variables `TEAM_PITCHING_H` and `TEAM_PITCHING_BB`).

```{r lm-select, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# Create model with select inputs (walks and hits allowed/gained)
lm_select <- lm(TARGET_WINS ~ TEAM_BATTING_H + TEAM_BATTING_BB + TEAM_PITCHING_H + TEAM_PITCHING_BB, train)

summary(lm_select)
```

```{r plot-lm-select, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
plot(lm_select)
```

It's interesting to note that with selected variables (walks and hits gained/allowed per team) that our adjusted $R^2$ actually went *down*, indicating the amount of variability in `TARGET_WINS` explained by our more selective walks/hits model is *less* than the model including all variables.

Looking at our residual plot above, there seems to be a clustering of residuals along the x-axis at $X \approx 80$. This shows a pattern in our residuals.

```{r plot-lm-select-residuals, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# Plot selective model residuals
plot(lm_select$residuals)

```

Let's plot our response variable (*Total Wins*) versus each of our predictor variables to get a sense of linear relationships.

```{r plot-select-vars, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# Plot our response variable for each predictor variable to get a sense of
plot(TARGET_WINS ~ TEAM_BATTING_H + TEAM_BATTING_BB + TEAM_PITCHING_H + TEAM_PITCHING_BB, data=train)

```

## Model Evaluation: 

We'll need to read in our [evaluation data](https://github.com/andrewbowen19/businessAnalyticsDataMiningDATA621/blob/main/data/moneyball-evaluation-data.csv), which is hosted on GitHub for reproduceability. 

```{r echo=FALSE}
eval_data_url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andrewbowen19/businessAnalyticsDataMiningDATA621/main/data/moneyball-evaluation-data.csv"

test <- read.csv(eval_data_url)
```

```{r}
predict(lm_all, test)
```
