```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)
```

## Setup:

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(glue)
library(tidyverse)
library(car)
library(ResourceSelection)
library(VIM)
library(pracma)
library(MASS)
select <- dplyr::select
library(knitr)
library(modelr)
```

First, let's read in the provided dataset.

```{r data-read-in, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
df <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andrewbowen19/businessAnalyticsDataMiningDATA621/main/data/moneyball-training-data.csv")
df <- data.frame(df)
```

## Data Exploration:

```{r dimensions, echo=F}
dim = dim(df)

print(glue("The dataset consists of {dim[1]} observations of {dim[2]} variables."))
```

The variables and their definitions can be seen below:

Variable|Definition
---|---
`INDEX`|Identification variable
`TARGET_WINS`|Number of wins
`TEAM_BATTING_H`|Base hits by batters (1B, 2B, 3B, HR)
`TEAM_BATTING_2B`|Doubles by batters (2B)
`TEAM_BATTING_3B`|Triples by batters (3B)
`TEAM_BATTING_HR`|Homeruns by batters (4B)
`TEAM_BATTING_BB`|Walks by batters
`TEAM_BATTING_HBP`|Batters hit by pitch (get a free base)
`TEAM_BATTING_SO`|Strikeouts by batters
`TEAM_BASERUN_SB`|Stolen bases
`TEAM_BASRUN_CS`|Caught stealing
`TEAM_FIELDING_E`|Errors
`TEAM_FIELDING_DP`|Double plays
`TEAM_PITCHING_BB`|Walks allowed
`TEAM_PITCHING_H`|Hits allowed
`TEAM_PITCHING_HR`|Homeruns allowed
`TEAM_PITCHING_SO`|Strikeouts by pitchers

`INDEX` is an identifying feature and should not be included in the linear regression model. 

```{r train-data, echo=FALSE}
set.seed(42)

# Adding a 20% holdout of our input data for model evaluation later
train <- subset(df[sample(1:nrow(df)), ], select=-c(TEAM_BATTING_HBP))%>%
          sample_frac(0.7)

test  <- dplyr::anti_join(df, train, by = 'INDEX')

train = subset(df, select=-c(INDEX))
```

Next, let's print out some summary statistics. We're primarily interested in the `TARGET_WINS` variable, so we'll look at that first.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
mean_wins <- mean(train$TARGET_WINS)
median_wins <- median(train$TARGET_WINS)
sd_wins <- sd(train$TARGET_WINS)

# Print summary stats
print(glue("The mean number of wins in a season is {round(mean_wins,2)}."))
print(glue("The median number of wins in a season is {median_wins}."))
print(glue("The standard deviation for number of wins in a season is {round(sd_wins,2)}."))
```

Let's also make a histogram of the `TARGET_WINS` variable. This should give us a sense of the distribution of wins for teams/seasons in our population.

```{r wins-hist, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.show='hold', fig.align='center', out.width='85%'}
ggplot(train, aes(x=TARGET_WINS)) + 
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Wins (Histogram)", x = "Number of Wins", y = "Count")
```

Overall, the number of wins in a season for a given baseball team looks fairly normally distributed. Looking at a boxplot helps to highlight the outliers.

```{r box-plot, echo=FALSE, fig.show='hold', fig.align='center', out.width='85%'}
ggplot(train, aes(x=TARGET_WINS)) + 
  geom_boxplot(fill="darkgrey") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Wins (Boxplot)", x = "Number of Wins", y = "Count")
```

We could describe the average team's season using the mean for all variables below:

```{r summary-stats0, echo=F}
cMeans <- as.data.frame(round(colMeans(train, na.rm = TRUE), 1))
colnames(cMeans) <- NULL
kable(cMeans, format = "simple")

```

## Data Preparation:

Let's take a closer look at all the summary statistics for these variables and identify any data completeness issues:

```{r summary-stats, echo=F}
summary(train)
```

We can see quite a few NA values for `TEAM_BATTING_SO`, `TEAM_BASERUN_SB`, `TEAM_BASERUN_CS`, `TEAM_BATTING_HBP`, `TEAM_PITCHING_SO`, and `TEAM_FIELDING_DP`. Let's take a look at the distributions of these variables to see how to impute these missing values.  

```{r dist-na-vars, echo=FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(2,3))
par(mai=c(.3,.3,.3,.3))

variables <- c("TEAM_BATTING_SO", "TEAM_BASERUN_SB", "TEAM_BASERUN_CS", "TEAM_BATTING_HBP", "TEAM_PITCHING_SO", "TEAM_FIELDING_DP")

for (i in 1:(length(variables))) {
    hist(train[[variables[i]]], main = variables[i], col = "lightblue")
}
```

`TEAM_BASERUN_SB`, `TEAM_PITCHING_SO`, and `TEAM_BASERUN_CS` seem to be skewed to the right so we should probably impute the missing values using the median value for these variables. `TEAM_BATTING_HBP` and `TEAM_FIELDING_DP` seem basically normally distributed so we can use the mean here, although `TEAM_BATTING_HBP` has 2,085 NA values out of 2,276 observations so it may make sense to leave this variable out of our model entirely. `TEAM_BATTING_SO` is bimodally distributed, so we have decided to use KNN imputation, which does not rely on the shape of the distribution, for this variable.

```{r impute-vars, echo=FALSE}
train_imputed <- train |>
    mutate(TEAM_BASERUN_SB = replace(TEAM_BASERUN_SB, is.na(TEAM_BASERUN_SB),
                                     median(TEAM_BASERUN_SB, na.rm=T)),
           TEAM_BASERUN_CS = replace(TEAM_BASERUN_CS, is.na(TEAM_BASERUN_CS),
                                     median(TEAM_BASERUN_CS, na.rm=T)),
           TEAM_PITCHING_SO = replace(TEAM_PITCHING_SO, is.na(TEAM_PITCHING_SO),
                                      median(TEAM_PITCHING_SO, na.rm=T)),
           TEAM_FIELDING_DP = replace(TEAM_FIELDING_DP, is.na(TEAM_FIELDING_DP),
                                      mean(TEAM_FIELDING_DP, na.rm=T))) |>
    select(-TEAM_BATTING_HBP)
    

train_imputed <- train_imputed |>
    VIM::kNN(variable = "TEAM_BATTING_SO", k = 15, numFun = weighted.mean,
             weightDist = TRUE) |>
    select(-TEAM_BATTING_SO_imp)

```

Let's look at raw correlations between our other included variables and a team's win total for a season: 

```{r basic-correlations, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
cor(train_imputed, df$TARGET_WINS)
```

None of the independent variables seem to have such high correlation with `TARGET_WINS`. `TEAM_BATTING_H` is most highly correlated, with a correlation of 0.39. `TEAM_BATTING_H`, `TEAM_BATTING_2B`, `TEAM_BATTING_3B`, `TEAM_BATTING_HR`, `TEAM_BATTING_BB`, `TEAM_BASERUN_SB`, `TEAM_BASERUN_CS`, `TEAM_PITCHING_HR`, and `TEAM_PITCHING_BB` are all positively correlated with `TARGET_WINS` while `TEAM_BATTING_SO`, `TEAM_PITCHING_H`, `TEAM_PITCHING_SO`, `TEAM_FIELDING_E`, and `TEAM_FIELDING_DP` are negatively correlated. 

Some of these correlations are surprising, as we would have expected `TEAM_BASERUN_CS`, `TEAM_PITCHING_HR`, and `TEAM_PITCHING_BB` to be negatively correlated with `TARGET_WINS`, and we would have expected `TEAM_PITCHING_SO` and `TEAM_FIELDING_DP` to be positively correlated with `TARGET_WINS`. We won't exclude them from our models based solely on this surprise, however. 

Let's review relationships between batting independent variables. 

```{r batting_rel, fig.show='hold', fig.align='center', out.width='60%'}
train_cleaned <- train_imputed |> rename_all(~stringr::str_replace(.,"^TEAM_",""))
subset_batting <- train_cleaned |> select(contains('batting'))
kdepairs(subset_batting)
```

Most of the batting variables appear to be somewhat approximately normal although there are some cases of right skew. Overall, there aren't any very strong correlations between these statistics at least from a preliminary visual inspection. From the distributions of these variables, we can see some that require transforming to normalize them before we use them in our linear model. 

Let's review relationships between other independent variables.

```{r pitching_rel, fig.show='hold', fig.align='center', out.width='80%'}
subset_pitching <- train_cleaned |> select(!contains('batting'), -TARGET_WINS)
kdepairs(subset_pitching)
```

There isn't very strong correlation between the other independent variables similar to the batting statistics although there are more examples of skewed data with these inputs. Once again, we can see that we will need to transform some of these variables. 

## Model Development:

First, let's create a basic model with all untransformed variables:

```{r scatter-plots, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
lm_all <- lm(TARGET_WINS~., train_imputed)
summary(lm_all)
```

We can see that the $R^2$ value of a model that includes all the variables is not particularly high. 

We can remove some variables that are not significant using backward step-wise elimination. 

```{r update-lm-all, echo=FALSE}
lm_all_reduced <- step(lm_all, direction="backward", trace = 0)
summary(lm_all_reduced)
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
The $R^2$ for this model is not much improved. Let's check for multicolinearity between variables.

>>>>>>> 3c1945e84a413cd7dc9c646dea0d7806941a8cdf

Reviewing the variance inflation factors:

```{r}
vif(lm_all_reduced)
```

The variance inflation factor for `TEAM_BATTING_SO` is greater than 5. We can remove this.

```{r}
lm_all_reduced <- update(lm_all_reduced, .~. - TEAM_BATTING_SO)
summary(lm_all_reduced)
```

Let's remove `TEAM_PITCHING_H` as it is no longer significant. 

```{r}
lm_all_reduced <- update(lm_all_reduced, .~. - TEAM_PITCHING_H)
summary(lm_all_reduced)
vif(lm_all_reduced)
```

Based on the definitions of `TEAM_BATTING_H`, `TEAM_BATTING_2B`, `TEAM_BATTING_3B`, and `TEAM_BATTING_HR`, there is probably some multicollinearity going on with these variables. Let's compare a model that uses just the total hits against a model using each individual type of hit.

```{r}
lm_all_reduced_hits <- update(lm_all_reduced, .~. - TEAM_BATTING_2B - TEAM_BATTING_3B - TEAM_BATTING_HR)
summary(lm_all_reduced_hits)
lm_all_reduced_others <- update(lm_all_reduced, .~. - TEAM_BATTING_H)
summary(lm_all_reduced_others)
```

The model using `TEAM_BATTING_HITS` has a higher $R^2$ so it accounts for more variability. Let's use this variable in our model. 

We can make some plots to help test our assumptions of our basic model using the `plot` function on our model variable:

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
par(mai=c(.3,.3,.3,.3))
plot(lm_all_reduced_hits)
```

The Q-Q plot shows that the residuals of this model are fairly normally distributed. The residuals vs. fitted plot shows a cluster of residuals and a seeming outlying point. There is no general pattern seen here and the cluster of points seems to indicate that homoscedasticity is satisfied for this model. 

Let's try transforming some of our variables to come up with a more accurate model. 

`TEAM_PITCHING_SO` is a right-skewed variable with very large outliers. Let's compare how four common transformations (log, fourth root, cube root, and square root) would normalize the distribution of this variable (after adding a small constant since the variable includes accurate values of 0).

```{r transformation_model1, echo = FALSE}
train_imputed_transformed <- train_imputed
#Add a small constant to TEAM_PITCHING_SO so there are no 0 values.
train_imputed_transformed$TEAM_PITCHING_SO <- train_imputed_transformed$TEAM_PITCHING_SO + 0.001
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
par(mai=c(.3,.3,.3,.3))
#Compare how easy to understand transformations alter the distribution
hist(log(train_imputed_transformed$TEAM_PITCHING_SO),
     main = "Log Transformation", col="lightblue")
hist(nthroot(train_imputed_transformed$TEAM_PITCHING_SO, 4),
     main = "Fourth Root Transformation", col="lightblue")
hist(nthroot(train_imputed_transformed$TEAM_PITCHING_SO, 3),
     main = "Cube Root Transformation", col="lightblue")
hist(sqrt(train_imputed_transformed$TEAM_PITCHING_SO),
     main = "Square Root Transformation", col="lightblue")
```

The square root transformation appears to normalize the data best. Let's confirm the ideal lambda proposed by the boxcox function from the MASS library is similar to to the square root transformation lambda (0.5) we assume will work best for this data. 

```{r transformation_model2, echo = FALSE}
bc <- boxcox(lm(train_imputed_transformed$TEAM_PITCHING_SO ~ 1),
             lambda = seq(-2, 2, length.out = 81),
             plotit = FALSE)
lambda <- bc$x[which.max(bc$y)]
lambda
```

The proposed lambda of 0.45 is in fact very close to 0.5, so we will go with the easier to understand square root transformation. We will follow a similar process to find reasonable transformations for several other variables in our model without showing the process repeatedly. 

```{r transformation_model3, echo = FALSE}
variables <- c("TEAM_BASERUN_SB", "TEAM_BASERUN_CS", "TEAM_PITCHING_SO",
               "TEAM_BATTING_3B", "TEAM_BATTING_BB", "TEAM_PITCHING_H",
               "TEAM_PITCHING_BB", "TEAM_FIELDING_E")
for (i in 1:(length(variables))){
    #Add a small constant to columns with any 0 values
    if (sum(train_imputed_transformed[[variables[i]]] == 0) > 0){
        train_imputed_transformed[[variables[i]]] <-
            train_imputed_transformed[[variables[i]]] + 0.001
    }
}
for (i in 1:(length(variables))){
    if (i == 1){
        lambdas <- c()
    }
    bc <- boxcox(lm(train_imputed_transformed[[variables[i]]] ~ 1),
                 lambda = seq(-2, 2, length.out = 81),
                 plotit = FALSE)
    lambda <- bc$x[which.max(bc$y)]
    lambdas <- append(lambdas, lambda)
}
lambdas <- as.data.frame(cbind(variables, lambdas))
adj <- c("log", "fourth root", "square root", "log", "square", "square inverse", "cube root", "inverse")
lambdas <- cbind(lambdas, adj)
kable(lambdas, format = "simple")
par(mfrow=c(3, 3))
par(mai=c(.3,.3,.3,.3))
#Compare how easy to understand transformations alter the distribution
hist(log(train_imputed_transformed$TEAM_BASERUN_SB),
     main = "Log(TEAM_BASERUN_SB)", col="lightblue")
hist(nthroot(train_imputed_transformed$TEAM_BASERUN_CS, 4),
     main = "Fourth Root(TEAM_BASERUN_CS)", col="lightblue")
hist(sqrt(train_imputed_transformed$TEAM_PITCHING_SO),
     main = "Square Root(TEAM_PITCHING_SO)", col="lightblue")
hist(log(train_imputed_transformed$TEAM_BATTING_3B),
     main = "Log(TEAM_BATTING_3B)", col="lightblue")
hist(train_imputed_transformed$TEAM_BATTING_BB^2,
     main = "TEAM_BATTING_BB SQUARED", col="lightblue")
hist(train_imputed_transformed$TEAM_PITCHING_H^-2,
     main = "TEAM_PITCHING_H INVERSE SQUARED", col="lightblue")
hist(nthroot(train_imputed_transformed$TEAM_PITCHING_BB, 3),
     main = "Cube Root(TEAM_PITCHING_BB)", col="lightblue")
hist(train_imputed_transformed$TEAM_FIELDING_E^-1,
     main = "TEAM_FIELDING_E INVERSE", col="lightblue")

```

Adjusting the ideal lambdas proposed for several variables to commonly understood transformations, we see mixed results on normalizing the distributions. Let's use the same variables from our final untransformed model above to see if we can improve the model using transformations.

```{r}
lm_trans <- lm(TARGET_WINS ~ TEAM_BATTING_H + TEAM_BATTING_BB + I(TEAM_BATTING_BB**2) + log(TEAM_BASERUN_SB + .0001) + I(TEAM_PITCHING_SO**.5) + I(TEAM_FIELDING_E**-1) + TEAM_FIELDING_DP, train_imputed)
summary(lm_trans)
```

Note: There are instances of `TEAM_BASERUN_SB` where the value is zero. Because of this, a log transformation creates an error. To account for this we increment by a small number (0.0001) so that the log transformation can be applied. 

The transformed `TEAM_PITCHING_SO` is no longer significant, let's remove it. 

```{r}
lm_trans_reduced <- update(lm_trans, .~. - I(TEAM_PITCHING_SO**.5), train_imputed)
summary(lm_trans_reduced)
```

The adjusted $R^2$ is slightly less for this model than for the untransformed one. Let's take a look at the diagnostic plots for this transformed model. 

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
par(mai=c(.3,.3,.3,.3))
plot(lm_trans_reduced)
```

Once again, the Q-Q plot shows that the residuals are fairly normally distributed. From the plot of Cook's distance, it seems there are fewer possible leverage points. The residuals vs. fitted plot also seems to indicate that homoscedasticity is satisfied. 

Now we can make a model with inputs that we know from baseball.

- Total hits (`TEAM_BATTING_H`)
- Total walks gained (`TEAM_BATTING_BB`)
- Total hits allowed (`TEAM_PITCHING_H`)
- Total walks allowed (`TEAM_PITCHING_BB`)

We chose these variables based on our understanding that good teams generally tend to get on base more frequently (positive predictor variables `TEAM_BATTING_HITS` and `TEAM_BATTING_BB`) while allowing *fewer* runners on base (negative predictor variables `TEAM_PITCHING_H` and `TEAM_PITCHING_BB`).

```{r lm-select, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Create model with select inputs (walks and hits allowed/gained)
lm_select <- lm(TARGET_WINS ~ TEAM_BATTING_H + TEAM_BATTING_BB + TEAM_PITCHING_H + TEAM_PITCHING_BB, train)

summary(lm_select)
```

```{r plot-lm-select, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
par(mai=c(.3,.3,.3,.3))
plot(lm_select)
```

It's interesting to note that with selected variables (walks and hits gained/allowed per team) that our adjusted $R^2$ actually went *down*, indicating the amount of variability in `TARGET_WINS` explained by our more selective walks/hits model is *less* than the model including all variables.

Looking at our residual plot above, there seems to be a clustering of residuals along the x-axis at $X \approx 80$. This shows a pattern in our residuals.

```{r plot-lm-select-residuals, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Plot selective model residuals
plot(lm_select$residuals)
```

Let's plot our response variable (*Total Wins*) versus each of our predictor variables to get a sense of linear relationships.

```{r plot-select-vars, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
par(mai=c(.3,.3,.3,.3))
plot(TARGET_WINS ~ TEAM_BATTING_H + TEAM_BATTING_BB + TEAM_PITCHING_H + TEAM_PITCHING_BB, data=train)
```

## Model Evaluation/Selection 

We'll need to read in our [evaluation data](https://github.com/andrewbowen19/businessAnalyticsDataMiningDATA621/blob/main/data/moneyball-evaluation-data.csv), which is hosted on GitHub for reproduceability. 
=======
**Discussion Missing**

## Model Evaluation/Selection:

First we read in our [evaluation data](https://github.com/andrewbowen19/businessAnalyticsDataMiningDATA621/blob/main/data/moneyball-evaluation-data.csv).

```{r echo=FALSE}
eval_data_url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andrewbowen19/businessAnalyticsDataMiningDATA621/main/data/moneyball-evaluation-data.csv"

eval <- read.csv(eval_data_url)
```

Now we can make some predictions on the test holdout data and compare results from our models before we select the best model to use on the evaluation data. 


```{r}
test <- drop_na(test)

# Predict using the model using all input variables
predict_all <- predict(lm_all, test)
predict_reduced <- predict(lm_all_reduced, test)

predict_all_transformed <- predict(lm_trans, test)
```


Writing a quick RMSE function
```{r}
rmse <- function(c1, c2){
  sqrt(mean((c1 - c2)^2))
}
```

We can use the [Root-mean Squared Error](https://statisticsbyjim.com/regression/root-mean-square-error-rmse/) (RMSE) (from the `modelr` package) to analyze our models from above. This is one way to measure the performance of a model. In simple terms, a smaller RMSE value indicates better model performance when predicting on new data.

```{r}
# Calcualte RMSE and print to screen
rmse_all <- modelr::rmse(lm_all, test)
rmse_reduced <- modelr::rmse(lm_all_reduced, test)
rmse_all_transformed <- modelr::rmse(lm_trans, test)

print(rmse_all)
print(rmse_reduced)
print(rmse_all_transformed)
```


Lastly, we can predict on our `eval` data based on the best RMSE value coming from our *reduced* model. Since we don't have `TARGET_WINS` in our evaluation data, we won't be able to evaluate the model performance against actual win totals. 


The model with the lowest RMSE is our all variable model without transformations, so we will make predictions on the evaluation data using this model. Since we don't have `TARGET_WINS` in our evaluation data, we won't be able to evaluate the model performance against actual win totals. 


However, we can look at the distribution of predicted wins to make sure our model predicts reasonable values. Knowing what we know about baseball, average teams tend to win $~80$ games in a season (out of 162 total regular season games). 

```{r}
# Predict and plot on evaluation data (no wins listed)
prediction_reduced <- predict(lm_all_reduced, eval)
predict_reduced_eval <- as.data.frame(prediction_reduced)

# Plot reduced model evaluation
ggplot(predict_reduced_eval,
       aes(x = prediction_reduced)) +
       geom_histogram(bins=15) +
       labs(x="Wins", 
            title="Predicted Wins (Reduced Model): Evaluation Data.")
```

Roughly speaking, these predicted win totals look roughly normal, and centered around 80 wins, which is expected
```{r}
predict_all_eval <- as.data.frame(predict(lm_all, eval))

ggplot(as.data.frame(predict_all_eval), aes(x = predict(lm_all, eval))) + geom_histogram(bins=15) + labs(x="Wins", title="Predicted Wins (All Variables Untransformed Model): Evaluation Data.")
```
